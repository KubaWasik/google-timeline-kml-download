# google-timeline-kml-download
This simple script create google session, download kml files for choosen period of time
and create shortcuts on desktop to google maps navigation for top 5 most visited places

The project was created in January 2018 and at that time it also worked.
After some time Google disabled downloading kml files in that way.
